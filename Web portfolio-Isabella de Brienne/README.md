 My process of creating a web Portfolio was interesting to say the least. I faced a few problems while creating it because I was going based off a mockup that I made and when I was originally creating the mockup I wasent thinking about what I was actually capable of coding so I had to do a bunch of research to figure out how to do things such as put a video in my code as ive never done that before. I learnt that making a web portfolio isint as easy as it may seem and that you really need to know what you are capable of doing before starting this process.
